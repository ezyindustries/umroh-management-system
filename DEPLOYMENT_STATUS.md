# Deployment Status - Umroh Management System

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- PostgreSQL database is running (via Docker container)
- Database `umroh_management` exists and is accessible
- Environment variables configured in `.env` file
- Changed from OpenAI to Claude API for AI features

### 2. Dependencies
- All NPM packages installed
- Added Anthropic SDK for Claude integration
- Fixed missing dependencies (axios, openai ‚Üí anthropic)

### 3. Code Fixes
- Fixed authentication middleware imports (`authMiddleware` ‚Üí `authenticate`)
- Updated marketing controller to use Claude instead of OpenAI
- Created simplified server (`server-simple.js`) to bypass undefined middleware issues

### 4. Services Running
- Backend API server running on port 5000 (simplified version)
- Demo web interface running on port 8888
- Database accessible on port 5432

### 5. Initial Data
- Admin user created:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
  - Roles: admin, finance, marketing, operations

### 6. New Features Added
- Created comprehensive flight booking system page (`flight-booking-system.html`)
- Linked flight menu in main app to redirect to new flight booking page
- Flight booking system includes:
  - PNR Management (CRUD operations)
  - Booking Jamaah to flights
  - Flight Schedule Management
  - Manifest Generation
  - Reports (Passenger lists, revenue, seat utilization)
  - Navigation back to main application

- **Demo Interface**: http://103.181.143.223:8888/demo-complete-umroh-app.html
- **Flight Booking System**: http://103.181.143.223:8888/flight-booking-system.html
- **API Health Check**: http://103.181.143.223:5000/api/health
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on localhost:5432

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **Route Loading**: The backend routes are not loading properly due to file structure issues
2. **Full Server**: The full `server.js` has many undefined middleware that need to be implemented
3. **AI Integration**: Claude API key needs to be configured for AI features to work

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate (For Testing):
1. Access the demo at http://103.181.143.223:8888/demo-complete-umroh-app.html
2. Login with admin/admin123
3. Test basic features (may have limited backend functionality)

### Short-term (For Full Production):
1. Fix route imports in server-simple.js
2. Implement missing middleware functions
3. Configure Claude API key
4. Setup WAHA for WhatsApp integration
5. Configure MinIO/S3 for file storage

### Production Deployment:
1. Use Docker Compose for consistent deployment
2. Setup SSL certificates
3. Configure proper domain
4. Setup backup automation
5. Configure monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Commands

```bash
# Check server status
ps aux | grep node

# View server logs
tail -f /home/ezyindustries/deployments/umroh-management/server.log

# Restart services
pkill -f "node server-simple.js"
cd /home/ezyindustries/deployments/umroh-management
nohup node server-simple.js > server.log 2>&1 &

# Access database
docker exec -it postgres-platform psql -U platform_admin -d umroh_management
```

## üìù Notes

- The system is partially functional for demo purposes
- Full backend functionality requires additional setup
- All business logic documentation is complete in MODULE_*.md files
- For production use, follow the deployment guide in DEPLOYMENT.md
